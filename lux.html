                            <div class="song">"Luxanna Crownguard hails from Demacia, an insular realm where magical abilities are viewed with fear and suspicion. Able to bend light to her will, she grew up dreading discovery and exile, and was forced to keep her power secret, in order to preserve her family’s noble status. Nonetheless, Lux’s optimism and resilience have led her to embrace her unique talents, and she now covertly wields them in service of her homeland.</p></div>

                            <h2 class="main">LORE</h2>
                            <div class="song">"Luxanna grew up in the Demacian city of High Silvermere alongside her older brother Garen. Like her brother, she was a heir to the the noble Crownguard family whom protected the king. While Garen was devoted to serving his country at an early age, Lux was forced to run her family's estates, which she was disinterested with. She was always curious and rebellious, wishing to find out what lied outside of Demacia's walls.
                                <br>
                                Magic was seen as evil in Demacian culture, ever since magic from the Rune Wars had nearly destroyed Valoran, and Lux's fear grew from the traumatic moment where her uncle was killed by a rogue mage. One night, she was attacked by a pack of sabrewulves and she ended up unleashing a spark of light, scaring them off. Lux became afraid of this revelation, worrying that the magic might corrupt her. She would practice her magic in private, and keep her abilities a secret from everyone.
                                <br>
                                When she was sixteen, Lux travelled with her parents Pieter and Augatha to witness Garen being accepted into the Dauntless Vanguard. Then they moved to Demacia's capital, which she admired due to being every aspect of the Demacia her family believed in. She learned about the Illuminators, a religious order who took care of the citizens and even secretly admitted mages. Lux believes that the Demacian way is not the only way, and it would be better if Demacia became more accepting of mages like herself.</div>
